## Inspiration
We wanted to develop a game to inspire passion about STEM topics through an engaging and social platform utilized by a diverse population of K-12 students

## What it does
K-12 students will be able to play the game and interact with the environment to demonstrate Newton's Three Laws of Motion. While students are playing the game, there will be occasional pop up questions to gauge understanding of Motion principles. While a student progresses through the lesson, they will receive points based on their performance which is held in a Cloud database. Finally, each students scores are passed to a website for the teacher to review and assess each students performance and tutor students who did not perform as well as needed

## How we built it
We used Roblox Studio to develop the game, implemented Microsoft Azure to host a MySQL server to store player information and ranking, and connected the Azure MySQL server to display student rankings to a Velo/Wix web application

## Challenges we ran into
Hosting using Azure was new to all of us and getting the APIs to interact with Velo by Wix proved troublesome

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to overcome all challenges above and additonally create multiple games to demonstrate Newton's 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Laws of Motion

## What we learned
MySQL hosting with Microsoft Azure, connections with Wix using an Azure app service and key vault, dynamic database linking with Wix, APIs to interact from Roblox to MySQL, and a fun name for our stack; RAWS (Roblox, Azure, Wix, MySQL)!

## What's next for DynaBlox
We hope to refine our project further to implement additional lessons in Physics
